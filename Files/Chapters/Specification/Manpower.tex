\subsection{How Assignment was done}

%The assignment of work for our team project followed a meticulous process to ensure the efficient utilization of each team member's skills and expertise. We initiated the process by \textbf{thoroughly documenting} everyone's \textbf{skillsets}, creating a comprehensive overview of the diverse talents within our team. This documentation played a crucial role in understanding the \textbf{strengths} and \textbf{capabilities} of each individual.

The first step in conducting this assignment efficiently was formation of sub-tribes. Each sub-tribe had 20-25 members. Each of the sub-tribe worked independently of each other to come up with ideas to solve the problem. After a thorough review of all the ideas, one final idea was selected. Approaching the idea formulation by formation of sub-tribes allowed us to come up with multiple great ideas. Each sub-tribe had creative freedom to brainstorm over their ideas. Sub-tribes met regularly over the weekend and within each sub-tribe there was further division of work. This approach resulted in the Tribe being very efficient and creative in its ideas.

Once the idea was finalised, we floated a form to understand the skillsets of the whole team. Based on the responses, the tribe was split into sub-teams to perform specific tasks to ensure the efficient utilization of each team member's skills and expertise. \textbf{Matching} the skills of team members with the demands of each task was a strategic approach that aimed to leverage their \textbf{unique} strengths. This thoughtful allocation of responsibilities not only optimized the utilization of individual skills but also fostered a \textbf{collaborative} environment where team members could complement each other's abilities.


The overall result was a well-coordinated and efficient team, where each member \textbf{contributed meaningfully} to the project. The thorough assignment of tasks according to skill-sets not only enhanced the quality of the work but also facilitated a smoother workflow, ultimately leading to the successful completion of each task within the \textbf{stipulated timelines}.


We used \textbf{OverLeaf} and \textbf{GitHub} to organise the project. The \textbf{.pdf} files were efficiently generate on \textbf{OverLeaf} after any changes to the file. We used \textbf{GitHub} to maintain the versions of the project. 


\subsection{Surplus Manpower}
We \textbf{did not} need any surplus man power.
% Our project's success was underscored by the remarkable synergy and competency within our existing team, obviating the need for surplus manpower. The meticulous process of documenting and aligning individual skillsets with specific tasks ensured that each team member played a crucial and meaningful role. This strategic allocation not only maximized the utilization of available talent but also highlighted the collective strength of our team.
