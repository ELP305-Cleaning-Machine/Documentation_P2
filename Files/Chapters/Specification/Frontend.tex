\section{Frontend Specifications}
\subsection{Display Unit}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item These units will be mounted at every bus stop
    \item This unit will tell the time left for the buses from both direction to arrive at the station using the \gls{sliding text animation}
    \item There will be one display unit per bus stop. Directional information will be displayed on the unit for buses from both directions
    \item When the units cannot connect to network, the time of arrival will be an extrapolation of the past arrival time data. The time of arrival will blink telling the maintenance staff that the unit is not connected to the network, but for the normal people it will be just the time of arrival
    \item The display unit will be solar power. This is the connection to be followed: \\Solar Panel$\to$ AC/DC converter $\to$ capacitor $\to$ Embedded system \\ \makebox[\linewidth]{OR}\\
          Solar Panel $\to$ \index{PWM converter}\gls{PWM converter} (or \index{MPPT converter}\gls{MPPT converter}) $\to$ \ac{USB} $\to$ \index{Embedded Systems}Embedded Systems
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Bus Mounted Units}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every bus will have a unit (BUk for the $k^{th}$ bus)
    \item The units will be powered from the battery of the bus
    \item While the bus is moving, these units will never be turned OFF
    \item These units will contain \gls{accelerometer} (to determine the state of the bus whether it is moving or not)
    \item These units will also contain a RED switch, when pressed it will signal the system that the bus is OUT OF SERVICE
\end{enumerate}
