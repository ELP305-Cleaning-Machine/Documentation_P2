\section{Motivation}

The existing bus transit system on campus lacks effectiveness, accessibility, and convenience. Uncertain wait times make it challenging for passengers to decide whether to wait for the next bus or seek alternative transportation. Recognizing this limitation, we are developing a solution to address this issue and enhance the convenience of the bus transportation system for passengers. We maximise renewable energy (in the form of solar energy) usage for this solution to minimise any overhead power costs and make a greener solution.
