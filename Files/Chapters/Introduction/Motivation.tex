\chapter{Motivation}

The existing bus transit system on campus lacks effectiveness, accessibility, and convenience. Uncertain wait times make it challenging for passengers to decide whether to wait for the next bus or seek alternative transportation. Recognizing this limitation, we have developed a solution to address this issue and enhance the convenience of the bus transportation system for passengers. Our solution prioritizes sustainability by being energy-efficient and compliant with evolving regulations across various industries.
