\section{Abstract}

his project introduces a system to assist users availing the bus facility inside the campus. Our solution consists of a Bus Mounted Unit that shows information about the bus's status on each bus as well as a sturdy, easily readable Display Unit at each stop that informs passengers of the bus's anticipated arrival time (as well as other important details). In addition to making an effort to be economical and energy-efficient, the system helps passengers by giving them important and beneficial details about the buses. This paper details the design process and technological integrations of this comprehensive bus assistance solution.
