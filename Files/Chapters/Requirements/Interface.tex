\section{Interface and Communication Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \underline{\textsc{Driver Notification for Passenger Wait Time}} : There's no obligation to inform the driver if a passenger waits for more than a minute. Waiting time is restricted to passenger boarding and deboarding.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Full Indicator for Passengers}} : The driver is not obligated to provide information to waiting passengers regarding the availability of space.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Feedback and Issue Reporting Mechanism}} : A digital interface could be implemented for users to provide feedback or report issues related to bus services.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Wait Time Interface}} : An interface can be devised to allow individuals heading to the bus stop to access information regarding the wait time.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Timeline for System Development}} : The desired timeline for the development, testing, and deployment of the system is April 25th, 2025.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Location Information Exchange}} : There's no need for each bus to be informed about the location of other buses.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Campus Bus Service Accessibility}} : Prioritizing full accessibility for all campus residents on the bus service is not necessary.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Connectivity Focus}} : Connectivity is exclusively between buses and stops, with no direct communication link to passengers.
    
    \item \underline{\textsc{Displaying Bus Capacity Information}} : It is unnecessary to display a bus's full status at upcoming stops, as passengers may alight at any point, which remains unpredictable to the driver.
