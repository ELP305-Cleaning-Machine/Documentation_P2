\section{Operational Requirements}

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \underline{\textsc{Passenger Wait Times and Safe Bus Speeds}} : Speeding to compensate for delays, even after a passenger waits over a minute and notifies the driver, is prohibited. Safety is paramount and arrival times may fluctuate accordingly.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Driver Notification for Passenger Wait Time}} : There's no obligation to inform the driver if a passenger waits for more than a minute. Waiting time is restricted to passenger boarding and deboarding.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Full Indicator for Passengers}} : The driver is not obligated to provide information to waiting passengers regarding the availability of space.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Updating Timings for Road Incidents}} : When there's an unexpected delay or a roadblock, the display will flash '999' to signal an emergency.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Feedback and Issue Reporting Mechanism}} : A digital interface could be implemented for users to provide feedback or report issues related to bus services.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Automation of Bus Operations}} :  It needs to be fully automated, manual input from the driver or staff for every bus direction change or stop is not expected.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Wait Time Interface}} : An interface can be devised to allow individuals heading to the bus stop to access information regarding the wait time.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Route and Passenger Notification}} : Notifying the bus driver about a waiting passenger does not affect the bus route, even if the bus is empty.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Stopping at Empty Bus Stops}} : The bus is not expected to make stops at empty bus stops.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Timeline for System Development}} : The desired timeline for the development, testing, and deployment of the system is April 25th, 2025.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Real-Time Bus Tracking}} : Real-time tracking of every bus is not required, but it is suggested to keep track of location and travel activity logs for around a month.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Bus U-Turn for Passengers}} : There may not be sufficient space at every stop for the bus to make a U-turn and onboard passengers on the reverse path.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Campus Bus Service Accessibility}} : Prioritizing full accessibility for all campus residents on the bus service is not necessary.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Location Information Exchange}} : There's no need for each bus to be informed about the location of other buses.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Early Bus Departure}} : Buses should not depart early, even if passengers have been waiting for over a minute, as it can confuse passengers and cause inconvenience

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Stop Wait Time}} : Buses typically aim to depart from each stop promptly after passengers have finished boarding and alighting.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Arrival and Departure Logging}} : The logging of bus arrival and departure must be automatic and cannot rely on manual input, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in tracking bus movements.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Centralized Bus Service Management}} : The bus service is centrally managed, with everything logged. While there's no real-time monitoring, logs are available for review. 

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Passenger Drop-off Notification}} : There is no notification received when a passenger enters the bus regarding their drop-off.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Bus Bypass Protocol}} : If the bus is already full, the driver does not need to stop the bus at every subsequent stop.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Connectivity Focus}} :Connectivity is exclusively between buses and stops, with no direct communication link to passengers.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Displaying Bus Capacity Information}} : It is unnecessary to display a bus's full status at upcoming stops, as passengers may alight at any point, which remains unpredictable to the driver.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Emergency Stops Policy}} : In emergency situations, like a passenger feeling nauseous, the bus will make unscheduled stops between designated stops to address the issue and prioritizing passenger safety and well-being.

%     \item \underline{\textsc{Differentiation of Waiting Passengers}} : The system should distinguish between transient presence and waiting passengers. Standing for 0.5 minutes qualifies someone as a potential passenger,with false positives accepted.
